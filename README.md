# Split Landing Page Project

This project is a split landing page that allows users to hover over one of two sections, causing one section to expand and the other to shrink. When the mouse is lifted, the sections share the screen evenly again.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Functionality

The split landing page is divided into two sections, each containing its own content. When the user hovers over one of the sections, that section expands to take up more screen space, while the other section shrinks. When the mouse is lifted, the sections share the screen evenly again.
